Chapbo ok Italic
typefaces by Feòrag NicBhrìde

The Chapbook family of typefaces is based on the type used in the 17th century equivalent of pulp literature. It
includes regular and italic fonts, and a set of period dingbats.
Version 3 has been radically reworked. The glyphs are more balanced, and the italics consistent. There are many
more characters and a few more illustrations have been added to the separate dingbats font. It is now an OpenType
font using Unicode—the long-s and various ligatures have moved accordingly. They can be found using the Glyphs/
Special Characters menu item in most MacOS X applications.
A number of special ligatures can be found in the Private Use area, and these can be accessed the same way.
This archive contains the TTF versions of the font, which can be used on MacOS X, Linux and Windows. It includes the following ﬁles:
