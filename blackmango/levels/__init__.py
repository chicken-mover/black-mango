"""
A simple level object for loading level data and tracking stuff that's
happening inside the level.

This class also controls what part of the level we're looking at at any given
moment, and keeps references to mobs and blocks for quick collision lookup.

The level's `tick` method is used to iterate and call the `behavior` method on
each mob in the level.
