"""
This module governs the core GameEngine class.

The GameEngine handles things like game state, the current level, loading and
saving the game, etc. Basically, anything that isn't at GameWindow level is
delegated to the GameEngine for dealing with.

GameEngine does NOT handle anything outside of the ongoing game. So the
initial load/save/new game/credits splash menu shouldn't be dealt with here.
