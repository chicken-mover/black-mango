This is still a thought in progress, but:

### somelevel.py
```python

SIZE = (1, 2, 3)
NAME = 'The Outer Courtyard'

NEXT_LEVEL = '???' # module or string?
PREV_LEVEL = '???'

# Because all of these lines are generated by a level editor, we don't need to
# lay them out in a particularly nice format.

# Backgrounds COULD be loaded from images, then pickled and stored here as their
# pyglet object representations.
BACKGROUNDS = {
    0: 'someimage',
    1: 'someimage',
}
PLAYER_START = (2, 3, 0)
BLOCKS = {
    (0,0,0): (1, (), {}),
    (0,1,0): (2, (), {}),
    (0,2,0): (3, (some,args,), {'somekwarg': 'someval'}),
    ...
}
MOBS = {
    (0,0,0): (1, (), {}),
    (0,1,0): (2, (), {}),
    (0,2,0): (3, (some,args,), {'somekwarg': 'someval'}),
    ...
}
```

Change saves to place you back at the start of whatever level you were on. This
basically means that within a single level, no progress is saved (although we
could think about a checkpoint system, I guess?)
